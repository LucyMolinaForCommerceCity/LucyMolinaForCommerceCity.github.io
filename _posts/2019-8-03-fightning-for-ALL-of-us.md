title: Fighting for ALL Of Us
description: Once you meet Lucy, you’ll never forget her and that’s why we say that “We love Lucy!”. Lucy has an amazing spirit - her genuine passion radiates good-will wherever she goes. Whether it’s at the Capitol advocating for environmental justice by testifying for bills to help Colorado move into the clean energy age, or at the Colorado State Board of Education fighting to save District 14’s brand new high school from private take-over, Lucy is there to stand up for what is right for the people of Commerce City. Lucy knows what it’s like to barely make ends meet. Lucy knows what it’s like to choose between paying the bills and the rent and feeding her family. She also knows what it’s like to have sick kids and an ailing mother without knowing why they continue to be plagued with unrelenting mysterious illnesses. Lucy knows there are solutions to these problems, but in order to solve these problems, there has to be people in a position of authority to first, recognize that there are problems, and then to find real solutions, and put those solutions into place. Lucy will be that council woman who gets things done, finding real solutions for real problems – the problems that many people know all too well and struggle with, only because the system is stacked against them. Lucy will be your voice and bring the change.
