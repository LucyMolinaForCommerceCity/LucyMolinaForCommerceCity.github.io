title: Meet Lucy Molina
description: I’m Lucy and I’m running for Council because I have a passion for people, and I believe it’s time that people like me have a voice and a seat at the table without having to bring my own chair. I want to represent you because I know your struggles in trying to make ends meet in a world that seems to make life difficult for people who are disadvantaged and may never have the same opportunities so accessible to others, especially a people of color. Running for office was not something I had in my plans. But after being approached by many friends and colleagues urging me to run, I decided I had to step up and say yes. I’ll admit, it wasn’t an easy decision to make. I am not a person of means. I have never worked in government. I don’t have special connections. I just know when things need to be better than they are, and I want to help to make those changes for the people that may not always be seen as deserving. I have always been an activist, while encouraging others to be courageous, get involved, and stand up for what’s right. Now is our time, and I encourage you to join me.

Once you meet Lucy, you’ll never forget her and that’s why we say that “We love Lucy!”. Lucy has an amazing spirit - her genuine passion radiates good-will wherever she goes. Whether it’s at the Capitol advocating for environmental justice by testifying for bills to help Colorado move into the clean energy age, or at the Colorado State Board of Education fighting to save District 14’s brand new high school from private take-over, Lucy is there to stand up for what is right for the people of Commerce City. Lucy knows what it’s like to barely make ends meet. Lucy knows what it’s like to choose between paying the bills and the rent and feeding her family. She also knows what it’s like to have sick kids and an ailing mother without knowing why they continue to be plagued with unrelenting mysterious illnesses. Lucy knows there are solutions to these problems, but in order to solve these problems, there has to be people in a position of authority to first, recognize that there are problems, and then to find real solutions, and put those solutions into place. Lucy will be that council woman who gets things done, finding real solutions for real problems – the problems that many people know all too well and struggle with, only because the system is stacked against them. Lucy will be your voice and bring the change.
