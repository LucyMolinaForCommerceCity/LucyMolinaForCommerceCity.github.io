title: Why I suppport Working Families
description: My Father is from El Paso Texas, and my Mother from Chihuahua, Mexico - both U.S. Citizens moved to Colorado in 1975 when I was 1 year old, the oldest of 5 siblings. My Grandmother and my Mother BOTH were community activists in the 60’s and 70’s with the Labor Movement, marching with Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta in El Paso Texas.  My Grandmother (Union Leader) was a WARRIOR. My Mother is a WARRIOR. I am a WARRIOR – I believe it is in my genes. They taught me to STAND UP for what’s right - to be the VOICE of the oppressed and to be MY OWN VOICE. I remember how PROUD my grandmother was when she signed my last Drivers Licenses Petition to give undocumented people the ability to get a license to drive in 2018. She said “Mija, if I was better, I would be knocking on doors with you!”. She passed away a few weeks later from cancer. I only wish she could be here now to know that I am following in her footsteps by running for City Council. My parents are my BIGGEST inspiration, they RISKED it all and moved to Colorado from Texas. No English. No family. No home. Only HOPE for a better life. They always remind me how we slept in the car - I was 1 year old when they got to Colorado and the winters were savage. Knowing their SACRIFICE, makes me want to be a better person, daughter, mother, aunt, friend, neighbor, and now a public servant. Knowing their sacrifice makes me want to be the voice for others. Now is my opportunity to do that, and I would be honored to serve you all as one of your At-Large Commerce City Councilors.
